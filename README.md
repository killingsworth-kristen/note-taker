# note-taker
## description
This app lets you create and save notes.

## Installation
No installation is required and can be access at this url: https://killingsworth-note-taker.herokuapp.com/

## Usage
On page load you will be taken to a page where you have to click the get started button. Once you click the button you will be takien to the note creation page. You can type in the title and description of the note. Hit the save icon in the upper right corner to save the note. If you refresh the page it will appear (there is a bug with the asynchronicity of the post and get requests). Additionally, the delete function does not currently work and is reserved for future development.

## Credits
Starter code was provided by the UW bootcamp which included all of the front end (everything in public, views, and db). I wrote all of the code in server.js.
